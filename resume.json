    "summary": "I have a passion for creativity through technology. I've been hacking software together since my childhood in the dial-up days of the mid to late '90s. In college, I studied Professional Music, then Film Production. In 2012, I shifted my professional focus to software. Since 2018, I've worked remotely, full-time, from my studio in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida. In my free time, I enjoy tinkering with hardware/software in my home lab, working on music/video projects, and pursuing extreme sports.",
